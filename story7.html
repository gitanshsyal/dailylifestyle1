  A self-educated mathematician, Ramanujan was known for his theorems that contributed significantly
  to understanding number series, infinite series and continued fractions.
  He was born in December of 1887 in Erode, Tamil Nadu. While almost all of his siblings 
  died in their infancy, he miraculously survived a case of smallpox at the age of two. 
  His intelligence began to shine when in school in Kumbakonam, he imbibed more mathematical knowledge than anyone of his age. 
  He studied a book on advanced trigonometry at 13, learnt cubic equations at 15, and devised his own methods of solving them. 
  By 16, he mastered a book called A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics, which held
  a collection of 5000 theorems.
  He then moved on to understanding the Bernoulli numbers.
  After graduating in 1904 from the Town Higher Secondary School, he joined the Government Arts College in Kumbakonam. He failed most of the subjects because he couldn’t focus on 
  anything other than math. After a stint at another college, he gave up getting a degree altogether.<br>
In 1909, he was married to 10-year-old Srimithi Janaki, and tutored students while he looked for a job. Meanwhile, the Indian Mathematics Society was set up by V. Ramaswamy Aiyer. Ramanujan, at this point, started mingling with India’s mathematicians, wowing them with his brilliance. In 1913, he began writing letters to British mathematicians. 
Out of these, G. H. Hardy was to be the one who would believe in Ramanujan’s skills.
Bidding farewell to his wife and child, Ramanujan arrived in England by ship in April 1914. This was the turning point in the 27-year-old’s life.
Once in Cambridge, Hardy and Littlewood combed through his collection of theorems. They found that while some of them already existed, many of them were new, unparalleled discoveries. In the next five years at Cambridge,
 Ramanujan published many of his work there, aided by Hardy.<br>
 Owing to his work on highly composite numbers, in 1916 he received a Bachelor of Science degree, which was later renamed to PhD. The next year, he became a part of the London Mathematical Society, and the year after that, he became a Fellow of Trinity College and Fellow of the Royal Society. He was one of the youngest (at 30) at the Society,
 being only the second Indian to become a Fellow there, and the first at Trinity.
 However, he returned to India in 1919. An onset of various kinds of illnesses had made him weak. Life for vegetarians was difficult during First World War, due to a scarcity of vegetables and fruits, which made him malnutritioned. He was then diagnosed with vitamin deficiency and tuberculosis.
In 1920, he died, aged 32, in Kumbakonam, but not before leaving the world with a plethora of theorems and discoveries in mathematics, 
which were researched and proved to be true years after his death.
<br>
Years after his death, his family home in Sarangapani Street, Chennai, was turned into a museum.
 An international journal called The Ramanujan Journal was launched, to publish all research and work related to his findings.
