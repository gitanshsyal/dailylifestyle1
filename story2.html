  <div class="col-md-12" style="color:black;font-size:20px">Believe it or not,miltary mythology is a thing.Maybe when it comes to serving your
  nation,the soldiers never actually die.This is the story of Baba Harbhajan Singh,an Indian army soldier,Who died in 1967 but his ghost is 
  believed to still be protecting his brothers-in-arms at the border.<br>
  Born in a village of Punjab in 1941,Harbhajan Singh enrolled himself in the Indian Army in 1956.In 1965,he was granted a commission and was posted 
  to serve with the 14 Rajput Regiment.It was in the year 1967,near Nathu-la pass,that Singh met his end after slipping and drowning in a glacier while he was
  leading a column of mules carrying supplies to lonesome outpost.His body was recovered after three days and cremated with due honors.But de really die?<br>
  Legend has it that it was his own ghost that led the search party to his own dead body.Soon after cremation,it is believed ,he appeared in one of
  his friends dream and asked him to erect a shrine in his memory.Following this,a shrine dedicated to Singh was built.<br>
  Even today,jawans posted at the Nathu-La post firmly believe that Singh's ghost protects them.Soldiers even believe that his ghost warns
  them of any impending attack at least three days in advance.Even the chinese,during flag meets,set a chair aside to honour Harbhajan Singh
  The water from his shrine is believed to heal ailing soldiers.Singh's shrine is guarded by barefooted soldiers, and his uniform and boots area 
  cleaned on a daily basis.Stories about his ghost visiting the camps at night and even waking up the soldiers who sleep while on watch,are 
  massively popular and very regular.<br>
  The belief about his paranormal existance is so firm that every year on 11th september,a train carrying his belongings departs for his 
  hometown accompanied by fellow soldiers and goes right till his home's doorstep.Morever,until his recent retirement,Singh was 
  steadily promoted up the ranks and retired as an Honorary captain.His salary has without fail been sent to his family up until his retirement
  .Singh is looked to as holy saint and referred to as  Baba.
