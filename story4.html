  Man of India, Late Dr. Abdul Kalam: The Man Who Taught Us to Be Human First!!<br>
  Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam usually referred as A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was the 11th President of India for the term 2002 to 2007. Popularly known as the People's President he was the chief brain behind India's attainment of the nuclear status in the global arena and was known as the ‘Missile Man of India’ 
  for his work on development of ballistic missiles and space rocket technology.<br>
  Last year it was noticed the presence of condolence messages about the demise of Dr A P J Abdul Kalam on banners held 
  at tea shops and auto rickshaws. At first, it was surprising and wonderful that why shop owners are displaying his picture and messages.
  In a country where hardly common men and women are aware about who the current President is, what is it that 
  made these people showcase love and affection on his death? It was definitely not a political cause as Kalam was not a political leader.
  It was because this man touched every heart in a big and meaningful way. It was on his third visit to Rajiv Gandhi 
  Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Shillong on July 27th, 2015 when the former President and world renowned 
  scientist collapsed while giving lecture to the students.<br>
  An ineffaceable mark is created in the minds of millions of Indians by our “People’s President” the late 
  Dr APJ Abdul Kalam. Very few eminent public figures that history has witnessed had created such a deep influence
  even after their demise.  This magical name sends an electrical signal to every soul in our country who wants to be
  truly successful. He always preferred to converse with people directly instead of using the web or the electronic media.
  He was very less aware of protocols and security measures. He loved spending quality time amongst students in various schools, 
  colleges and universities to interact
  with them and to inspire them to be better individuals when they grow up.<br>
  There were about 70 scientists working on a very hectic project. All of them were really frustrated due to the pressure of work and the demands of their boss but everyone was loyal to him and did not think of quitting the job.
  Now i would love to link one incident with this article.<br>One day, one scientist came to his boss and told him – Sir, I have promised to mychildren that I will take them to the exhibition going on in our township. So I want to leave the office at 5 30 pm. His boss replied “OK, You’re permitted to leave the office early today”. The Scientist started working. He continued his work after lunch. As usual he got involved to such an extent that he looked at his watch when he felt he was close to completion. The time was 8.30 PM. Suddenly he remembered of the promise he had given to his children.
  He looked for his boss, He was not there. Having told him in the morning itself, he closed everything and left for home.
  Deep within himself, he was feeling guilty for having disappointed his children. He reached home. Children were not there. His wife alone was sitting in the hall and reading magazines.
  The situation was explosive, any talk would boomerang on him.
  His wife asked him “Would you like to have coffee or shall I straight away serve dinner if you are hungry.
  The man replied “If you would like to have coffee, I too will have but what about Children ??” .Wife replied “You don’t know?? , Your manager came here at 5.15 PM and has taken the children to the exhibition “.
  What had really happened was …. The boss who granted him permission was observing him working seriously at 5.00 PM. He thought to himself, this person will not leave the work, but if he has promised his children they should enjoy the visit to exhibition. So he took the lead in taking them to exhibition The boss does not have to do it every time. But once it is done, loyalty is established.
  That is why all the scientists at Thumba continued to work under their boss even though the stress was tremendous.
  By the way, can you hazard a guess as to who the boss was ?
  He was none other than Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam . <br>Another incident that i would link with this article of Dr abdul kalam Azad
  This happened when Dr Kalam was with the Defence Research and Development organization (DRDO) and his team was discussing options to secure the perimeter of a building that needed protection. Dr Kalam reportedly said: 
  “If we do that, birds will not be able to perch on the wall. Think of something else. ”<br>
  As the President, Dr. Kalam was entitled to invite any two people as the “Presidential Guests” to the Raj Bhavan of Kerala 
  during his first visit to Trivandrum. He had spent a significant amount of time as a scientist in Trivandrum and guess who he called?
  a roadside cobbler who was quite close to Dr. Kalam
  during his time in Kerala; and an owner of a very small hotel where Dr. Kalam used to have his meals.
  This gesture was more than enough to show his level of simplicity!<br>
  Quora user Naman Narain shared the below incident from his life.
 “It was the year 2005 and I was braving the onslaught of class 6’s academic pressure.
  I happened to come across a book recommended by my elder brother. It was ‘Wings of Fire’ by the missile man.A short and inspiring book. After completing it, I picked up my sketching pad. That book had Kalam’s face sketched on it. And my immediate inspiration was this sketch. Within half an hour, I had sketched the exact image and was proudly showing it off to my family. My mother got super excited (even more than me!) and asked me to mail it to the President. I didn’t take her seriously. In my defense, I sarcastically said ‘ya right, he is your father and he would be happy to get a sketch from his grandchild’ and walked away. BOOM-BOOM-BAM. 30 min later, 
  I was trotting along my mother to post the sketch to the best address in this country: Rashtrapati Bhawan, Delhi.
  20 days later, a letter from The President of India with my name on the envelope was delivered. A LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA WITH MY NAME ON THE ENVELOPE WAS DELIVERED! Being on ‘cloud infinity’ is how I would define the feeling. Jumping and shouting I ran to my mother. Tears of joy started trickling down her face. I opened the prized-envelope with utmost care and took out a small note.
  It said ‘Dear Naman Narain, Thank you for your nice drawing. With best wishes from, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam’. It was personally written and signed by him!”
  These incidents prove why Dr Kalam is widely loved and respected by everyone ! You will continue to inspire us, sir!.
