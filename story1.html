  obstacle an opportunity while celebrating the journey-be it through the toughest of hardships and emerge as a fighter to give the entire world an inspiration
  Comeback.<br>Yuvraj Singh's Cancer story is a living treatment of how far a human soul can go and how much power each of us have ourselves if we
  have the zeal to fight back to life for the passion we have.Yuvi is the man who revoltionized the fielding standards of Indians and also the hero of 
  2007 and 2011 World cups.Morever,he is man who refused to give up and played the 2011 CWC though he was struggling to manage his breath,frequent
  vomiting,lung pain and nausea because he chose to give his best than losing it to his adverse health situations.He was unable to sleep that nights,he
  had to eat painkillers and sleeping pills for Sleep.He Said-" He know he could die if he didn't give up cricket but he said he would love to

  pressing against Yuvi's left lung and artery.Admidst the breathelessness and bouts of nausea,he was constantly in a dilemma whether he would be to
  come back to life as a winner defeating cancer and live life even bigger or was that going to be end of it.<br>

  <br>"I was inspired By Lance Armstrong when i was going through Cancer.It's tough when you go through a period like this in
your life when you don't know where your life is going to go."<br>

long and mentally draining phase of his life,he said it was important to be mentally srong since stronger one is mental,the stronger the 
body starts believing it is.He went stating he had to work harder on his body to prepare for a healthy comeback to follow his dreams and achieve
