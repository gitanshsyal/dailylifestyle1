  Comeback.<br>Yuvraj Singh's Cancer story is a living treatment of how far a human soul can go and how much power each of us have ourselves if we
  have the zeal to fight back to life for the passion we have.Yuvi is the man who revoltionized the fielding standards of Indians and also the hero of 
  2007 and 2011 World cups.Morever,he is man who refused to give up and played the 2011 CWC though he was struggling to manage his breath,frequent
